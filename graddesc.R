#### NOTE: This file needs helper functions which are defined in other files, that is: 
####        simple-function.R
####  OR    error_function.R
####  The above are two alternative files that provide identically named functions but with 
####  different functionality; therefore, 'sourcing' any one of them will override the functionality
####  of the other.
####  Start off by sourcing as below: 
####      source("simple-function.R")  
####  OR  source("error_function.R")
####  Then
####      source("grad-descent.R")   # this file
####  See comments in simple-function.R and error_function.R.
